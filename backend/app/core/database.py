Database Configuration and Connection Management

This module handles all MongoDB database operations for the Mortal Stardust platform.
It provides async connection management, collection access, and database initialization
using the Motor async driver for optimal performance in the FastAPI async environment.

The database architecture supports:
- Async connection pooling for high-concurrency operations
- Comprehensive indexing strategy for query optimization
- Collection-specific access methods for type safety
- Automatic database initialization and schema setup
- Connection lifecycle management with proper cleanup

Key Collections:
- users: User accounts and authentication data
- experiences: User-submitted life experiences and context
- solutions: AI-generated solutions for each processing stage
- solution_ratings: User feedback and rating data
- media_files: Uploaded multimedia content (images, audio, video)
- experience_summaries: Processed experience analysis results
- analytics_results: User analytics and insights data

Performance Considerations:
- Compound indexes for common query patterns (userId + createdAt)
- Unique indexes for data integrity (email, user+solution ratings)
- Background index creation to avoid blocking operations
- Connection pooling to handle concurrent requests efficiently

Dependencies:
- Motor: Async MongoDB driver for Python
- PyMongo: MongoDB driver for connection and error handling
- Pydantic Settings: Configuration management from environment variables

    2. Support time-based sorting and filtering (createdAt, timestamp)
    3. Ensure data integrity with unique constraints
    4. Enable efficient compound queries for complex operations

    Index Strategy:

    - Unique indexes for data integrity (email, user+solution combinations)

    - Reduces database CPU usage for common operations
    - Enables efficient pagination and sorting
