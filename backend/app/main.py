"""
Mortal Stardust (äººé—´æ˜Ÿå°˜) - AI-Powered Personal Growth Counseling Platform

This module serves as the main entry point for the FastAPI backend application.
It configures the web server, middleware, database connections, and API routing
for the three-stage AI processing system that helps users process life experiences
and receive personalized guidance.

The application follows a modular architecture with:
- Feature-based API routers organized by domain (auth, experiences, solutions, AI processing)
- Async MongoDB operations with Motor driver for scalable data persistence
- JWT-based authentication with HTTP Bearer token security
- CORS middleware configured for frontend integration
- Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the request lifecycle

Key Components:
- Three-stage AI processing pipeline (emotional support, practical solutions, follow-up)
- Multi-modal experience collection (text, audio, image, video)
- User role-based templates and personalized recommendations
- Solution rating system for continuous AI improvement
- Privacy-first design with field-level encryption and GDPR compliance

Dependencies:
- FastAPI: Modern async web framework for building APIs
- Motor: Async MongoDB driver for database operations
- Pydantic: Data validation and settings management
- OpenAI: AI model integration for experience processing
- Cryptography: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data protection

    The startup process includes:
    - Connecting to MongoDB using the configured connection string
    - Testing the database connection with a ping command
    - Creating optimized indexes for all collections to improve query performance
    - Initializing experience summary database components
    - Setting up any background tasks or scheduled jobs

    The shutdown process includes:
    - Closing the MongoDB connection pool
    - Canceling any running background tasks
    - Flushing any pending database operations
    - Cleaning up temporary files and cache

    This is critical for production deployments where the application
    may be restarted or scaled down frequently.
