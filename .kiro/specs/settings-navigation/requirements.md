# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical UX issue where users cannot access the existing settings page through the application's navigation. Currently, a comprehensive settings page exists at `/settings` with profile management, notifications, privacy, security, and preferences sections, but there are no navigation entry points for users to reach it. This creates an orphaned page that significantly impacts user experience and platform usability.

The feature will add proper navigation entry points to make the settings page discoverable and accessible, following standard UX patterns for user account management.

4. WHEN the user is not logged in THEN the settings option SHALL NOT be visible in any navigation
