# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing static settings page into a fully functional user profile and preferences management system. Currently, the settings page at `/settings` displays comprehensive UI components for profile management, notifications, privacy, security, and preferences, but all form controls use static default values without backend integration. Users cannot actually save changes or see their real data.

The feature will connect the settings UI to the existing backend APIs and create new endpoints where needed, enabling users to view, edit, and persist their account settings across all five settings categories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view my actual profile information in the settings page, so that I can see my current account details and make informed updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the profile settings tab THEN the system SHALL display their actual profile data from the database
2. WHEN profile data is loaded THEN the form fields SHALL be populated with the user's firstName, lastName, role, avatar, phoneNumber, dateOfBirth, and bio
3. WHEN the user's avatar exists THEN it SHALL be displayed instead of the default placeholder
4. WHEN profile data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
5. WHEN profile data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display error messages and fallback to empty form fields

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to update my profile information and have changes saved to the database, so that my account reflects my current details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user modifies profile fields and clicks save THEN the system SHALL validate the input data
2. WHEN profile data is valid THEN the system SHALL send updates to the backend API
3. WHEN the profile update succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success message and update the UI with new data
4. WHEN the profile update fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages without losing user input
5. WHEN sensitive fields like phoneNumber are updated THEN they SHALL be encrypted before storage
6. WHEN the user uploads a new avatar THEN it SHALL be processed and stored securely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to manage my notification preferences and have them applied to my account, so that I receive communications according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views notification settings THEN the system SHALL display their current notification preferences from the database
2. WHEN a user toggles notification switches THEN the changes SHALL be saved immediately or on form submission
3. WHEN notification preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL apply them to future communications
4. WHEN a user sets notification timing preferences THEN they SHALL be validated and stored in the user's timezone
5. WHEN notification settings fail to save THEN the system SHALL revert the UI state and show error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to control my privacy settings and data sharing preferences, so that I can manage how my data is used by the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views privacy settings THEN the system SHALL display their current privacy preferences from the database
2. WHEN a user changes data sharing settings THEN the updates SHALL be saved and applied to their account
3. WHEN a user sets data retention preferences THEN the system SHALL schedule automatic data deletion according to their choice
4. WHEN a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and execute secure data removal
5. WHEN privacy settings are updated THEN the system SHALL log the changes for compliance auditing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to manage my account security settings including password changes and two-factor authentication, so that I can protect my account from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views security settings THEN the system SHALL display their current security configuration (2FA status, active sessions)
2. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL validate the current password and enforce security requirements for the new password
3. WHEN a user enables/disables two-factor authentication THEN the system SHALL guide them through the setup/removal process
4. WHEN a user views active sessions THEN the system SHALL display real session data with device and location information
5. WHEN a user terminates sessions THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate the selected sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to customize my interface preferences and AI assistant settings, so that the platform adapts to my usage patterns and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views preferences settings THEN the system SHALL display their current theme, language, and AI assistant preferences
2. WHEN a user changes theme settings THEN the changes SHALL be applied immediately to the interface
3. WHEN a user changes language preferences THEN the system SHALL update the interface language and save the preference
4. WHEN a user modifies AI assistant settings THEN the changes SHALL affect future AI interactions and responses
5. WHEN preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL persist them across browser sessions and devices

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want all settings changes to be validated and handled with proper error management, so that I have a reliable and secure settings experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any settings form is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all input data before processing
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific field-level error messages
3. WHEN backend operations fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages and maintain form state
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and offline indicators
5. WHEN settings are successfully saved THEN the system SHALL provide clear confirmation feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings page to handle loading states and data synchronization properly, so that I have a smooth and responsive user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the settings page loads THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators while fetching user data
2. WHEN switching between settings tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and avoid unnecessary API calls
3. WHEN multiple settings are changed rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates gracefully
4. WHEN the user navigates away with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL warn them about potential data loss
5. WHEN settings data is updated elsewhere THEN the system SHALL refresh the current view to show the latest data
