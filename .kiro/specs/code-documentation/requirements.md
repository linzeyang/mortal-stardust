# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Mortal Stardust (人间星尘) codebase is a complex AI-powered personal growth counseling platform with both frontend (Next.js/TypeScript) and backend (FastAPI/Python) components. While the code is generally well-structured, it lacks comprehensive inline documentation that would help developers understand the purpose, behavior, and context of various functions, classes, and components. This feature aims to systematically add meaningful comments throughout the codebase to improve maintainability, onboarding experience, and code comprehension.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the codebase, I want comprehensive inline comments for complex functions and classes, so that I can quickly understand their purpose and implementation details without having to reverse-engineer the logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer encounters a complex function or method THEN the system SHALL provide clear JSDoc/docstring comments explaining the function's purpose, parameters, return values, and any side effects
2. WHEN a developer reviews class definitions THEN the system SHALL include class-level comments describing the class purpose, main responsibilities, and usage patterns
3. WHEN a developer examines business logic functions THEN the system SHALL provide comments explaining the business context and decision rationale
4. WHEN a developer looks at API endpoints THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive docstrings with parameter descriptions, response formats, and error conditions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want clear configuration and setup comments, so that I can understand how different parts of the system are configured and connected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reviews configuration files THEN the system SHALL provide comments explaining each configuration option's purpose and impact
2. WHEN a developer examines middleware and setup code THEN the system SHALL include comments describing the initialization process and dependencies
3. WHEN a developer looks at database connection and schema files THEN the system SHALL provide comments explaining the data model relationships and constraints
4. WHEN a developer reviews environment-specific configurations THEN the system SHALL include comments about deployment and environment considerations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the AI processing pipeline, I want detailed comments for the three-stage AI processing system, so that I can understand the flow, data transformations, and integration points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer examines AI stage processing functions THEN the system SHALL provide comments explaining the stage purpose, input/output formats, and processing logic
2. WHEN a developer reviews AI service classes THEN the system SHALL include comments describing the AI model integration, prompt engineering, and response handling
3. WHEN a developer looks at background task processing THEN the system SHALL provide comments explaining the async processing flow and error handling
4. WHEN a developer examines AI result encryption/decryption THEN the system SHALL include comments about security considerations and data protection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on the frontend components, I want clear comments for React components and hooks, so that I can understand component behavior, state management, and user interaction patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reviews React components THEN the system SHALL provide JSDoc comments for component props, state variables, and key methods
2. WHEN a developer examines custom hooks THEN the system SHALL include comments explaining hook purpose, dependencies, and usage patterns
3. WHEN a developer looks at form handling and validation logic THEN the system SHALL provide comments describing validation rules and user experience considerations
4. WHEN a developer reviews UI state management THEN the system SHALL include comments explaining state transitions and side effects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on data models and database operations, I want comprehensive comments for schemas and queries, so that I can understand data relationships, constraints, and business rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer examines Pydantic models THEN the system SHALL provide field-level comments explaining business meaning and validation rules
2. WHEN a developer reviews database query functions THEN the system SHALL include comments describing query purpose, performance considerations, and data relationships
3. WHEN a developer looks at data encryption/decryption utilities THEN the system SHALL provide comments explaining security implementation and usage guidelines
4. WHEN a developer examines database indexes and collections THEN the system SHALL include comments about performance optimization and query patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues or adding features, I want comments that explain complex algorithms and business logic, so that I can understand the reasoning behind implementation decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer encounters complex conditional logic THEN the system SHALL provide inline comments explaining the business rules and edge cases
2. WHEN a developer reviews error handling code THEN the system SHALL include comments describing error scenarios and recovery strategies
3. WHEN a developer examines performance-critical sections THEN the system SHALL provide comments explaining optimization techniques and trade-offs
4. WHEN a developer looks at integration points with external services THEN the system SHALL include comments about API contracts and failure handling
